# LUA-extensions-to-SIMION

This is a collection of LUA code written to add extra functionality to the software package SIMION. These files will need a "barn door" plate to hit for detection with space for ions to enter so that SIMION counts them as in that instance.

Note: These files are stored here mainly for my own convenience.
